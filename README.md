# Pickle Inspector

`pickle_inspector` is a static analysis tool to detect **insecure deserialization vulnerabilities** in Python projects — especially those involving `pickle.load()`, `yaml.load()`, and [other unsafe sinks](#insecure-deserialization-sinks-supported). It identifies flows from user-controlled inputs to deserialization sinks, including cases like:

- `pickle.load(open(...))` with user-influenced file paths
- `pickle.load(request.files['file'])` directly from uploads
- Dangerous patterns across multiple files and function calls


## Insecure Deserialization Sinks Supported

The tool statically detects usage of the following **deserialization functions**, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or data tampering when handling untrusted input:

| Sink                                  | Description |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| `pickle.load()`                       | Code execution risk if attacker controls input |
| `pickle.loads()`                      | Same as `pickle.load` but for in-memory data |
| `pickle.Unpickler.load()`            | Can be used in custom deserialization flows, still uses pickle internally |
| `joblib.load()`                       | Common in ML pipelines, relies on pickle under the hood |
| `sklearn.externals.joblib.load()`     | Legacy scikit-learn import path for joblib, also uses pickle |
| `cloudpickle.load()`                  | Like pickle, used in distributed computing (e.g., Dask, Ray) |
| `cloudpickle.loads()`                 | In-memory variant of `cloudpickle.load()` |
| `dill.load()`                         | Extends pickle, supports serializing more object types |
| `dill.loads()`                        | Like `dill.load`, but operates on in-memory byte strings |
| `marshal.load()`                      | Can load arbitrary Python bytecode (rarely used outside stdlib) |
| `marshal.loads()`                     | Same as above but from byte strings |
| `shelve.open()`                       | Implicitly uses pickle to load persistent storage |
| `yaml.load()`                         | Unsafe: can instantiate arbitrary objects when used with default loader |
| `torch.load()`                        | Used in PyTorch — internally uses pickle, exploitable via model files |
| `torch.jit.load()`                    | Loads TorchScript models, also uses pickle internally |
| `numpy.load()`                        | Unsafe if `allow_pickle=True` (loads .npy/.npz files using pickle) |
| `pandas.read_pickle()`               | Loads DataFrames using pickle under the hood |
| `keras.models.load_model()`           | Can deserialize pickled objects inside HDF5 model files |

> ⚠️ If these functions are used with attacker-controlled input — directly or indirectly — they are flagged with appropriate **risk levels** (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) based on flow analysis.

Additional sinks can be added by editing `sources_and_sinks.py`.

## Features

- Detects insecure usage of deserialization sinks (e.g., `pickle`, `marshal`, `yaml`, `shelve`, etc.)
- Tracks both file-based and stream-based flows
- Identifies tainted sources like `request.files`, `input()`, `sys.argv`, etc.
- Supports Python 2 syntax conversion (optional)
- Handles individual files or entire directories
- Progress bar and scan timing
- Graceful handling of Ctrl+C
- Results are sorted by risk severity
- Optional `--verbose` mode for full trace explanation

## Design Overview

- **AST-based analysis** (no runtime execution)
- All source code is parsed from temporary copies — your files are never modified
- Python 2 files are converted in-memory if `--py2-support` is enabled
- Reporting uses `rich` tables (if available), falls back to plain text
- Taint tracking models common user-input flows, including Flask/Django

## Setup (Recommended: Virtual Environment)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pickle_inspector.git
cd pickle_inspector
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Scan a directory:

```bash
python3 cli.py --skip-errors ./my_project/
```

### Scan a single file:

```bash
python3 cli.py ./vulnerable_app.py
```

### With Python 2 support:

```bash
python3 cli.py --py2-support ./legacy_project/
